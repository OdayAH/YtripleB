    <h1> Benefits of Pay-Per-Click Advertising </h1>
<p>For businesses embracing Online Marketing for the first time, Pay-Per-Click Advertising is often the starting point or “low hanging fruit” of an Online Marketing Strategy. <br> This is because PPC provides businesses with an opportunity to “get in the market” and gain visibility, almost instantly. By positioning carefully crafted advertisements in front of consumers searching online for your products and services, we can drive an enormous amount of prospects to your website. <br> For businesses with a mature Online Marketing strategy, Pay-Per-Click is one of many staples and a cost-effective way to drive website traffic and build brand awareness.</p>

        <h1>Remarketing on The Google Display Network</h1>
        <p>Remarketing on the GDN allows you position contextual and display ads in front of consumers who have previously visited your website. Cost-effective and subtle, remarketing is a reminder to the consumer that they have an interest in your products and services. <br><br>
            If you’re curious as to how remarketing works, it’s rather simple. A snippet of code or a ”cookie” is dropped into the web browser of a site visitor, as they surf the internet, we provide them with a gentle reminder of your products and services. Like Google ads & PPC, you have control over reach and frequency.

                 <h1>Does PPC Management Help My Organic Ranking?</h1>
            <p>Is a question we hear often and our take is this! There is NO correlation between how much you spend on pay-per-click and how well your website ranks organically, locally or both. We do know that user experience or the UX of site visitors, whether via PPC, referral (social media), organic or local search, is weighted in Google’s algorithm.
                <br><br> If you have questions on how to rank higher organically and or locally, visit our SEO page.
