        <h1>Website Design </h1>
        <p>As a business, chances are that you already know just how important a website is going to be. Not only does it give you the chance to showcase your brand, but also share news and sell products if that is what you do. Whilst it is vital to have a website, it is equally as important to make sure that you invest in good website design too.<br>

    <h1>Professionalism</h1>
    <p>A website that doesn’t look good will look unprofessional. Whether it is fair or not, a visitor (and potential customer) is going to judge the professionalism of your company on your website. If your website doesn’t look good, or it looks outdated and amateur, then this is how you will be seen.</p>

    <h1>Mobile Design</h1>
    <p>Your website needs to be mobile responsive. More and more people have moved away from only surfing and shopping on their computer or laptop and instead are doing most of this on their mobile device. With such a large part of your audience using mobile devices, it makes sense that one incredibly important thing to do is to make sure that your website is not just mobile friendly but is actually mobile optimised.</p>

        <h1>User Experience</h1>
        <p>You need to provide the best customer experience It doesn’t take long for a possible customer to become bored or frustrated when visiting a website. In fact, it is only a matter of seconds before a broken link or a page failing to load before they turn off and move away to your competitor’s website.</p>

            <h1>Visuals</h1>
            <p>A website needs to work well and it needs to look good; but what exactly is meant by just right? It is important that you get the perfect balance between words and visuals, as well as making sure that the finishing touches are right, such as the font that you use and that the colour scheme works well together too. Not always the easiest of balancing acts to achieve.</p>
